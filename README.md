This repo stores code and examples shown at our meetups. Learn more about this group by visiting our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Nijmegen-eveRybody/).

## Contributing:

If you're presenting at our Meetup, please follow these directions to post code to this repo.

0. Fork this repository (create a GitHub account and [read more about forking and pull requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) if necessary).
0. Create a new directory using the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-topic-here`.
0. Place your code and any data files in this directory. Data should be in a plain text format (tab or comma-separated -- do not commit .Rdata or other binary files). If using knitr or rmarkdown, compile your .Rmd to .md and commit both. Do not commit HTML or binary files like PDFs or Word documents. Please try to avoid committing images totaling larger than 1MB unless absolutely necessary. With very large datasets, consider hosting elsewhere or releasing an R data package on CRAN. Do not use any absolute paths -- use relative paths only.
0. Create a README.md file in the directory you created above giving some general information about your code (general overview of what you're covering, assumed R experience level, packages used, desired outcomes of presenting this material, etc.).
0. Commit (with a useful message) and push these changes to your master branch.
0. Submit a pull request to the master branch of this repo.
